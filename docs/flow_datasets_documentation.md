## Data Conversion Guidelines

### Standard Flow Matrix Format

All datasets must be converted to our standard JSON format:

```json
{
    "organization": "Dataset Name",
    "flows": [
        [0, 10.5, 5.2],
        [3.1, 0, 8.7],
        [2.4, 4.3, 0]
    ],
    "nodes": ["Node A", "Node B", "Node C"],
    "metadata": {
        "source": "Original data source",
        "description": "Dataset description", 
        "units": "Flow measurement units",
        "flow_type": "energy|material|financial|information|trade",
        "scale": "small|medium|large|very_large|massive",
        "created": "2025-01-27T12:00:00Z",
        "url": "https://source-url.com",
        "conversion_notes": "Any special processing notes"
    }
}
```

### Conversion Process

#### Step 1: Data Exploration
- Download and examine raw data structure
- Identify potential node entities
- Locate flow relationships
- Document data quality and completeness

#### Step 2: Node Identification
- Extract unique entities that can serve as network nodes
- Create consistent node naming convention
- Handle duplicate or similar entities
- Document node characteristics

#### Step 3: Flow Extraction
- Identify relationships between nodes
- Quantify flow volumes/intensities
- Handle temporal aggregation if needed
- Validate flow consistency

#### Step 4: Matrix Construction
- Create square flow matrix (n x n)
- Ensure row/column correspondence with nodes
- Handle missing or zero flows appropriately
- Validate matrix properties

#### Step 5: Quality Validation
- Check matrix dimensions and consistency
- Verify non-negative flows (where appropriate)
- Validate against known totals or benchmarks
- Document assumptions and limitations

### Common Challenges and Solutions

#### Challenge: Temporal Data
**Problem**: Many datasets provide time series rather than static flows  
**Solution**: Aggregate flows over appropriate time periods, or create multiple snapshots

#### Challenge: Asymmetric Relationships  
**Problem**: Some datasets show only unidirectional relationships  
**Solution**: Create directed flow matrix, use zeros for missing reverse flows

#### Challenge: Multiple Flow Types
**Problem**: Datasets may contain different types of flows  
**Solution**: Create separate matrices for each flow type, or aggregate meaningfully

#### Challenge: Scale Differences
**Problem**: Flow magnitudes vary dramatically  
**Solution**: Document units clearly, consider normalization for comparison
