# Changelog

All notable changes to the Adaptive Organization Analysis project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [2.0.0] - 2026-03-13

### Added
- **Dark mode UI** with nature/ecosystem color palette (forest green, gold, teal)
- **OASIS health assessment model** — five-dimension organizational scoring (Open, Autonomous, Symbiotic, Intelligent, Sustainable)
- **Professional PDF report generator** using reportlab with cover page, table of contents, embedded charts, headers/footers
- **Publication-quality report narratives** structured to Big Four audit-firm standards
- **Interactive documentation system** with in-app tooltips and metric reference
- **SQLite metrics database** with precomputed metrics for faster re-analysis
- **HuggingFace dataset discovery agent** for finding relevant network datasets
- **Ecosystem sample datasets** — US airports, Bitcoin transactions, pharma R&D, manufacturing networks
- **Streamlit theme configuration** (`.streamlit/config.toml`)
- **Sustainability reporting auditor agent** for report quality assurance

### Changed
- All Plotly charts updated for dark backgrounds with legible text and nature palette
- Report content restructured from bullet-heavy academic style to narrative audit-firm format
- Robustness curve: blue dotted line changed to green, star marker changed to orange
- PDF charts force light theme for print readability
- README rewritten with OASIS branding and updated project structure
- `docs/requirements.txt` updated with all dependencies (streamlit, reportlab, kaleido)

### Fixed
- Orphaned headings in PDF (added `keepWithNext` to heading styles)
- Chart axis clipping in PDF exports (added generous margins)
- Unicode characters causing black squares in PDF (replaced with ASCII equivalents)
- Table splitting across pages causing IndexError (switched to `ROWBACKGROUNDS`)
- Placeholder URLs in documentation files
