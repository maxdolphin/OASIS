## 🚀 **Getting Started**

### **Development Setup**
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/ExentriqLtd/Exentriq-Adaptive-Organization-Analysis.git
cd Adaptive_Organization

# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r docs/requirements.txt

# Install development dependencies
pip install pytest black flake8 mypy
```

### **Running Tests**
```bash
# Run all tests
pytest

# Run specific test file
pytest tests/test_ulanowicz_calculator.py

# Run with coverage
pytest --cov=src
```

### **Code Style**
- Use Black for code formatting: `black src/ tests/`
- Follow PEP 8 guidelines
- Add type hints where appropriate
- Write docstrings for all public functions

## 🔬 **Theoretical Framework**

When contributing, please consider:

- **Ulanowicz's Ecosystem Theory**: Maintain theoretical consistency
- **Regenerative Economics**: Align with sustainability principles  
- **Network Ecology**: Respect information-theoretic foundations
- **Systems Thinking**: Consider emergent properties and feedback loops

## 📋 **Pull Request Process**
