COPY YOUR SCREENSHOT IMAGES TO THIS DIRECTORY

I can see your three images. Here are the exact commands to run from Terminal:

COMMANDS TO RUN:
Navigate to your Screenshots folder and run these commands:

cd "/Users/massimomistretta/Screenshots"

# 1. SUSTAINABILITY FORMULA:
cp "Screenshot 2025-08-28 at 11.40.02 AM.png" "/Users/massimomistretta/Claude_Projects/Adaptive_Organization/images/sustainability_formula.png"

# 2. COMPUTATION PROCESS FLOWCHART:  
cp "Screenshot 2025-08-28 at 11.40.34 AM.png" "/Users/massimomistretta/Claude_Projects/Adaptive_Organization/images/computation_process.png"

# 3. For the WINDOW OF VIABILITY curve, I'll extract it from the same image or you can provide a standalone curve image:
cp "Screenshot 2025-08-28 at 11.40.34 AM.png" "/Users/massimomistretta/Claude_Projects/Adaptive_Organization/images/window_viability.png"

IMAGE MAPPINGS:
✓ sustainability_formula.png = Screenshot 2025-08-28 at 11.40.02 AM.png (C = A + Φ formula)
✓ computation_process.png = Screenshot 2025-08-28 at 11.40.34 AM.png (flowchart with legend)  
✓ window_viability.png = Screenshot 2025-08-28 at 11.40.34 AM.png (contains the curve)

Once copied, refresh your browser to see the actual mathematical diagrams in the Overview section!
