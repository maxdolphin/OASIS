# Images Directory

This directory contains images used in the Adaptive Organization Analysis tool.

## Required Images

To display the actual mathematical diagrams in the Overview section, copy your screenshot images to this directory with these names:

1. **sustainability_formula.png** - The sustainability balance formula diagram (C = A + Î¦)
2. **computation_process.png** - The computation process flowchart  
3. **window_viability.png** - The window of viability curve/robustness diagram

## How to Add Images

1. Copy your screenshot files from `/Users/massimomistretta/Screenshots/` to this directory
2. Rename them to match the expected filenames above
3. The Streamlit app will automatically display these images instead of ASCII art

## Example Commands

```bash
# From the project root directory:
cp "/Users/massimomistretta/Screenshots/Screenshot 2025-08-28 at 11.40.02 AM.png" images/sustainability_formula.png
# Add other images as needed
```

The images will be displayed with proper captions and formatting in the Formulas Reference > Overview section.
