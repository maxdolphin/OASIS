## Core Information Theory Formulations

### 1. Development Capacity (C)
```
C = -T.. × Σ(Tij/T..) × log(Tij/T..)
```
- **Equation (11)** in the paper
- Represents total capacity for system development
- Units: flow-bits

### 2. Ascendency (A)
```
A = T.. × Σ(Tij/T..) × log[(Tij × T..)/(Ti. × T.j)]
```
- **Equation (12)** in the paper  
- Represents organized power/constrained flow
- Units: flow-bits

### 3. Reserve/Overhead (Φ)
```
Φ = C - A
```
- **Equation (13)** in the paper
- System flexibility and reserve capacity
- Units: flow-bits

### 4. Relative Ascendency (α)
```
α = A/C
```
- Key sustainability metric
- Dimensionless ratio (0 to 1)
- **Optimal value: α_opt = 0.4596** (derived from window of vitality)

### 5. Robustness/Fitness (R)
```
R = T.. × F
where F = -(e/log(e)) × α^b × log(α^b)
```
- **Equation (17)** in the paper
- b = 1.288 (empirically derived for ecosystems)
- Maximum robustness at α = e^(-1/b) ≈ 0.460

## Window of Vitality (Figure 4, page 31)

### Boundaries for Sustainable Ecosystems:
- **Effective connectivity (ξ)**: 1.0 ≤ ξ ≤ 3.01
- **Effective trophic levels (η)**: 2.0 ≤ η ≤ 4.5
- **Optimal center**: ξ = 1.25, η = 3.25
- **Corresponding α_opt = 0.4596**

### Interpretation:
- α < 0.20: System too chaotic (low organization)
- α > 0.60: System too rigid (over-organized)
- 0.20 ≤ α ≤ 0.60: Viable system

## Cone Spring Ecosystem Analysis

### Original Network (Figure 5):
- **Relative Ascendency (α)**: 0.418
- **Status**: Below optimal (0.460)
- **Interpretation**: System can still grow and develop
- **Key pathway**: 1→2→3 (Plants→Detritus→Bacteria)
- **Marginal contributions**: 
  - Flows along main pathway have values >1
  - Parallel flows have values <1

### Eutrophicated Network (Figure 6):
- **Modification**: Added 8000 kcal m⁻² y⁻¹ to pathway 1→2→3
- **Relative Ascendency (α)**: 0.529
- **Status**: Above optimal (0.460)
- **Interpretation**: System has excess ascendency, reduced reserve
- **Marginal contributions**: 
  - Main pathway contributions now <1
  - Parallel flows now >1 (system needs diversity)

## Marginal Contribution Formula (Equation 18)

```
∂R/∂Tij = F + T.. × F' × [log(Tij×T../Ti.×T.j) + α×log(Tij²/Ti.×T.j)]
```

Where F' is the derivative of F with respect to α:
```
F' = -e×b×α^(b-1)×[log(α^b)/log(e) + 1]
```

### At optimum (α = α_opt):
- F = 1 and F' = 0
- Each unit increment in any flow contributes exactly 1 unit to robustness

### Away from optimum:
- **When α < α_opt**: Large flows contribute >1, small flows <1
- **When α > α_opt**: Large flows contribute <1, small flows >1

## Prawns-Alligator Subnetwork Example

### Configuration 1 (Figure 1): Three Pathways
- **Total System Throughput**: 102.6 mg C m⁻² y⁻¹
- **Ascendency**: 53.9 mg C-bits m⁻² y⁻¹
- **Reserve**: 121.3 mg C-bits m⁻² y⁻¹

### Configuration 2 (Figure 2): Most Efficient Path Only
- **Total System Throughput**: 121.8 mg C m⁻² y⁻¹
- **Ascendency**: 100.3 mg C-bits m⁻² y⁻¹
- **Reserve**: 0 mg C-bits m⁻² y⁻¹
- **Problem**: No resilience, complete collapse if fish fail

### Configuration 3 (Figure 3): After Fish Loss (with alternatives)
- **Total System Throughput**: 99.7 mg C m⁻² y⁻¹
- **Ascendency**: 44.5 mg C-bits m⁻² y⁻¹
- **Reserve**: 68.2 mg C-bits m⁻² y⁻¹
- **Result**: System adapts, maintains function

## Key Theoretical Insights

### 1. Fundamental Relationship
```
C = A + Φ
```
- Must hold exactly (validation check)
- Error should be < 0.1%

### 2. Sustainability Principle
- Systems need balance between efficiency (A) and resilience (Φ)
- Pure efficiency leads to brittleness
- Pure redundancy leads to inefficiency
- Optimal balance around α ≈ 0.37-0.46

### 3. Evolution as Moderation
- Not just "survival of the fittest" (efficiency)
- Requires maintaining reserve capacity
- Systems can be "too efficient for their own good"

### 4. Applications Beyond Ecology
- Economic systems
- Genetic control networks  
- Immune systems
- Any network with flows/transformations

## Validation Points for Our Implementation

1. **Check fundamental relationship**: C = A + Φ (error < 0.001)
2. **Verify α bounds**: 0 < α < 1
3. **Test robustness peak**: Should occur near α = 0.460
4. **Validate marginal contributions**: 
   - At α_opt, all flows contribute 1.0
   - Below α_opt, main flows >1, parallel <1
   - Above α_opt, main flows <1, parallel >1
5. **Window of viability**: Systems should be viable for 0.2 < α < 0.6

## Formula Corrections to Implement

The paper uses **natural logarithms** (ln) throughout, not log₂:
- All logarithms should be natural log (base e)
- Information units are "nats" not "bits" when using ln
- The scaling factor k = T.. gives units of "flow-nats"
